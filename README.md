# self-driving-car
A sunday fun project! It is a virtual slef driving car inspired by programming hero's youtube video.
It uses python's library pygame to detect hurdles and turn. 
All you need to do is run the script and let the car take you on a drive.
There are 5 scripts based on complexity of path, 5th is the most complex. These paths are straight line.
Moving the car on curved roads will be another sunday's project.
